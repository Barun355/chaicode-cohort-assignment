# HTML Resume Project

## What is this?

This is a simple resume website made using HTML and CSS. It shows information about a person's background, skills, work experience, and projects.

## What does it contain?

The `index.html` file includes:

- **Header** - A person's name and short title
- **About Me** - A short description about who they are
- **Skills** - A list of things they can do (like programming languages and tools)
- **Experience** - A table showing jobs they have worked on
- **Projects** - Information about projects they have built
- **Education** - A table showing their school and college information
- **Contact** - Email, phone, and location details

## Styling
